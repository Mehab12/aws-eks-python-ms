1.      Clone the Repository: https://github.com/sameh-Tawfiq/Microservices
2.      Dockerize the Application: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Python application.
3.      Provision a Kubernetes Cluster: Use Terraform to provision a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider of your choice (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) preferred Azure.
4.      Deploy the Microservice: Deploy the containerized Python microservice on the Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes YAML files.
5.      Expose the Service to the Internet: Ensure the deployed service is accessible externally by configuring a Kubernetes LoadBalancer or Ingress of your choice.
